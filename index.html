            <h1>Overview</h1>

            Vulkan is a new open standard API by Khronos that offers low-level
            control of GPUs for graphics and general purpose computation. It has
            been designed from the ground up around the capabilities of modern
            hardware.

            <ul class="features">
                <li>
                    <h2>Direct GPU control with minimal driver overhead</h2>

                    <p>
                        For example, data is written directly to GPU memory
                        instead of using calls equivalent to glUniform.
                        Applications can implement their own memory allocation
                        strategies. (<a href="http://blog.imgtec.com/powervr/trying-out-the-new-vulkan-graphics-api-on-powervr-gpus">Source</a>)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another feature is the <em>render pass</em>, which
                        offers control over loading of render targets at the
                        start and end of renders, which is very useful for
                        tiling architectures.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Multi-threading friendly architecture</h2>

                    <p>
                        Multiple threads can create and populate command buffers
                        at the same time, which can then be submitted to the GPU
                        by a separate thread.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Unified API for desktop, mobile and embedded platforms</h2>

                    <p>
                        There is no equivalent of OpenGL ES, Vulkan offers the
                        same API on all platforms.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Intermediate bytecode for shaders</h2>

                    <p>
                        The driver accepts shaders in the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/1.0/SPIRV.pdf">SPIR-V</a> bytecode
                        format. Khronos will supply a separate compiler for GLSL
                        that targets this intermediate format. Third-party
                        developers will be able to write their own compilers for
                        other languages.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            All of these features lead to simpler drivers, more predictable
            performance, more control and less differences between vendor
            implementations. (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan">Source</a>)

            <h1>API</h1>

            <p>
                The official specification isn't going to be released until
                later this year, but some details can be gathered from various
                sources.
            </p>

            The blog post linked above offers some insight. API calls have the
            <code>vk</code> prefix and functions take the state that they will
            change as their first parameter.

            <pre>
    vkCmdBindDescriptorSet(cmdBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, textureDescriptorSet[0], 0);
    vkQueueSubmit(graphicsQueue, 1, &cmdBuffer, 0, 0, fence);
    vkMapMemory(staticUniformBufferMemory, 0, (void **)&data);
    // ...
    vkUnmapMemory(staticUniformBufferMemory);
            </pre>

            <p>
                All hardware that supports OpenGL 4.3 / OpenGL ES 3.1 (<a href="https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/ES3_1_compatibility.txt">Subset</a>) or
                later can also support Vulkan.
            </p>

            <p>
                A talk by Khronos on March 5 has offered some more insight into
                the API. The Vulkan API still uses no special types, instead
                settling for <code>stdint.h</code> types. The closest thing to
                the concept of a context is now a command buffer.
                Synchronization is done using events and allows for fences
                and resource barriers. The full presentation can be watched
                below.

            <p>
                There was also a presentation by Valve earlier that day offering <a href="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2015-gdc/Valve-Vulkan-Session-GDC_Mar15.pdf">an overview</a>.
            </p>

            <h1>SPIR-V</h1>

            <p>
                Khronos has published a whitepaper that provides an
                <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/papers/WhitePaper.pdf">introduction to the SPIR-V intermediate language</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/1.0/SPIRV.pdf">provisional specification</a> is also available.
            </p>

            <h1>Drivers</h1>

            <p>
                Valve has been working on open source Linux drivers for Intel GPUs (<a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Valve-Intel-Vulkan-Driver">Source</a>).
            </p>

            <h1>Tools</h1>

            Valve, LunarG, Codeplay and other parties are already developing
            tools. Displayed below is an introduction video of a Vulkan
            debugger being developed by Valve and LunarG.

            </p>

            <p>
                Khronos has announced that these utilities will be available at
                the same time as the first drivers. (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/overview/2015_vulkan_v1_Overview.pdf">Source</a>)
            </p>

            <p>
                LunarG also states that these tools and the first drivers will
                be available to developers in 2015. (<a href="http://lunarg.com/vulkan/">Source</a>)
            </p>

            <h1>Demos</h1>

            <a href="http://imgtec.com/">Imagination Technologies</a> has
            developed a proof-of-concept driver for Vulkan for their PowerVR
            GPUs. They have ported an OpenGL ES 3.0 demo to Vulkan.

            <p>
                <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdnRI0nquKc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </p>

            Valve has developed a Vulkan driver for Linux that targets Intel
            GPUs. (<a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Valve-Intel-Vulkan-Driver">Source</a>) They've shown Dota 2 running with this driver.
