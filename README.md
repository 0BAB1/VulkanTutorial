The website is currently in development and will be moved to this repository on release. Watch this repository or sign up for the mailing list on https://vulkan-tutorial.com to be notified as soon as the site is released.

A rough overview of the content that will be available on release:

* Setting up for Vulkan on Windows and Linux
* Rendering a simple triangle
* Using vertex and index buffers
* Uniforms, textures and samplers

More chapters will be added later on topics like post-processing effects and the compute API. Note that this will be first and foremost an API tutorial written for developers who're already familiar with linear algebra and 3D math, however knowledge of neither OpenGL nor Direct3D will be required.

No specific release date can be provided at this time. The website will be based on the [daux.io](https://github.com/justinwalsh/daux.io) framework.
