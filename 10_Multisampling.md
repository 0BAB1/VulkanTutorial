## Introduction
Our program can now load and render 3D models. In this chapter, we will add one more feature, mipmap generation. Mipmaps are widely used in games and rendering software, and Vulkan gives us complete control over how they are created. 

Mipmaps are precalculated, downscaled versions of an image. Each new image is half the width and height of the previous one.  Mipmaps are used as a form of *Level of Detail* or *LOD.* Objects that are far away from the camera will sample their textures from the smaller mip images. Using smaller images increases the rendering speed and avoids artifacts such as [Moir√© patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern). An example of what mipmaps look like:

## Checking for multisampling support

First, add a class member that will store the number of samples used by the renderer. This number will be used in various places in our code:

```c++
...
VkSampleCountFlagBits msaaSamples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
...
```

Having done that, we now need to determine what is the maximum number of samples supported by the hardware. This information can be extracted from `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties` associated with our selected physical device. We're using a depth buffer, so we have to take into account the sample count for both color and depth - the lower number will be the maximum we can support:

```c++
VkSampleCountFlagBits getMaxUsableSampleCount() {
    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties physicalDeviceProperties;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(physicalDevice, &physicalDeviceProperties);

    VkSampleCountFlags counts = std::min(physicalDeviceProperties.limits.framebufferColorSampleCounts, physicalDeviceProperties.limits.framebufferDepthSampleCounts);
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_64_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_64_BIT; }
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_32_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_32_BIT; }
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_16_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_16_BIT; }
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_8_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_8_BIT; }
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_4_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_4_BIT; }
    if (counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_2_BIT) { return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_2_BIT; }

    return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
}
```

If the hardware supports only one sample (unlikely on modern graphics cards) the final image will look the same as before. We will now use this function to set the `msaaSamples` variable during physical device selection process. For this, we have to slightly modify the `pickPhysicalDevice` function:

```c++
void pickPhysicalDevice() {
            ...
            if (isDeviceSuitable(device)) {
                physicalDevice = device;
                msaaSamples = getMaxUsableSampleCount();
                break;
            }
            ...
}
```

Next, update `createImage` functions to allow us to specify the number of samples by adding a `numSmaples` parameter - this will become important later:

```c++
void createImage(uint32_t width, uint32_t height, uint32_t mipLevels, VkSampleCountFlagBits numSamples, VkFormat format, VkImageTiling tiling, VkImageUsageFlags usage, VkMemoryPropertyFlags properties, VkImage& image, VkDeviceMemory& imageMemory) {
    ...
    imageInfo.samples = numSamples;
    ...
```

For now, update all calls to these functions using `VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT` - we will be replacing this with proper values as we progress with implementation:

```c++
createImage(swapChainExtent.width, swapChainExtent.height, 1, VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT, depthFormat, VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT, depthImage, depthImageMemory);
...
createImage(texWidth, texHeight, mipLevels, VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT, VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM, VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT, VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT, textureImage, textureImageMemory);
```

## Setting up render targets

Multisampling requires additional render targets. Add following class members:

```c++
...
VkImage colorImage;
VkDeviceMemory colorImageMemory;
VkImageView colorImageView;

VkImage depthMsaaImage;
VkDeviceMemory depthMsaaImageMemory;
VkImageView depthMsaaImageView;
...
```

We will now create a multisampled color buffer. Add a `createColorResources` function and note that we're using `msaaSamples` here as a function parameter to `createImage`. We're also using only one mip level, since this buffer will be rendered fullscreen at all times and Vulkan specifications states that an image buffer with sample count greater than 1 can only have a single mip level:

```c++
void createColorResources() {
    VkFormat colorFormat = swapChainImageFormat;

    createImage(swapChainExtent.width, swapChainExtent.height, 1, msaaSamples, colorFormat, VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT, VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT, colorImage, colorImageMemory);
    colorImageView = createImageView(colorImage, colorFormat, VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT, 1);

    transitionImageLayout(colorImage, colorFormat, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL, 1);
}
```

For consistency, call the function right before `createDepthResources`:

```c++
void initVulkan() {
    ...
    createColorResources();
    createDepthResources();
    ...
}
```

You may notice that the newly created color image transitions from undefined state to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` which is a new case for us to handle. Let's update `transitionImageLayout` function to take this into account:

```c++
void transitionImageLayout(VkImage image, VkFormat format, VkImageLayout oldLayout, VkImageLayout newLayout, uint32_t mipLevels) {
    ...
    else if (oldLayout == VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED && newLayout == VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL) {
        barrier.srcAccessMask = 0;
        barrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT | VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT;
        sourceStage = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT;
        destinationStage = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT;
    }
    else {
        throw std::invalid_argument("unsupported layout transition!");
    }
    ...
}
```

Now that we have multisampled color buffer in place it's time to take care of depth. Modify `createDepthResources` and create a multisampled depth buffer:

```c++
void createDepthResources() {
    ...
    createImage(swapChainExtent.width, swapChainExtent.height, 1, msaaSamples, depthFormat, VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT, depthMsaaImage, depthMsaaImageMemory);
    depthMsaaImageView = createImageView(depthMsaaImage, depthFormat, VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT, 1);

    transitionImageLayout(depthMsaaImage, depthFormat, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL, 1);
}
```

We whave now creates a couple of new Vulkan resources, so let's not forget to release them when necessary:

```c++
void cleanupSwapChain() {
    vkDestroyImageView(device, colorImageView, nullptr);
    vkDestroyImage(device, colorImage, nullptr);
    vkFreeMemory(device, colorImageMemory, nullptr);
    vkDestroyImageView(device, depthMsaaImageView, nullptr);
    vkDestroyImage(device, depthMsaaImage, nullptr);
    vkFreeMemory(device, depthMsaaImageMemory, nullptr);
    ...
```

## Using multisampling

With only a few simple steps we created additional buffers and image views necessary for multsampling and also determined how many samples we can use on the hardware we're using - it's now time to put it all together and see the results! We'll take care of the render pass first. Modify `createRenderPass` and update color and depth attachment creation info structs:

```c++
void createRenderPass() {
    ...
    colorAttachment.samples = msaaSamples;
    colorAttachment.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
    ...
    depthAttachment.samples = msaaSamples;
    ...
```

Apart from the obvious change that tells the attachments to use more samples, you'll notice a change to the `finalLayout` parameter to the color attachment. This is because the multisampled color buffer will be only used to store color pixels now - for presentation, we can only use a single-sampled attachment. This also applies to multisampled depth, which means we need to create additional resolve attachments:

```c++
    ...
    VkAttachmentDescription colorAttachmentResolve = {};
    colorAttachmentResolve.format = swapChainImageFormat;
    colorAttachmentResolve.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
    colorAttachmentResolve.loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;
    colorAttachmentResolve.storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE;
    colorAttachmentResolve.stencilLoadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;
    colorAttachmentResolve.stencilStoreOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;
    colorAttachmentResolve.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;
    colorAttachmentResolve.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR;

    VkAttachmentDescription depthAttachmentResolve = {};
    depthAttachmentResolve.format = findDepthFormat();
    depthAttachmentResolve.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
    depthAttachmentResolve.loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;
    depthAttachmentResolve.storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE;
    depthAttachmentResolve.stencilLoadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;
    depthAttachmentResolve.stencilStoreOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;
    depthAttachmentResolve.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;
    depthAttachmentResolve.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
    ...
```

Add atachment reference for color:

```c++
    ...
    VkAttachmentReference colorAttachmentResolveRef = {};
    colorAttachmentResolveRef.attachment = 2;
    colorAttachmentResolveRef.layout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
    ...
    subpass.pResolveAttachments = &colorAttachmentResolveRef;
    ...
```

Update render pass info struct with new attachments:

```c++
    ...
    std::array<VkAttachmentDescription, 4> attachments = {colorAttachment, depthAttachment, colorAttachmentResolve, depthAttachmentResolve };
    ...
```

With render pass in place, modify `createFrameBuffers` and add additional attachments:

```c++
void createFrameBuffers() {
        ...
        std::array<VkImageView, 4> attachments = {
            colorImageView,
            depthMsaaImageView,
            swapChainImageViews[i],
            depthImageView
        };
        ...
}
```

Finally, tell the newly created pipeline to use more than one sample by modifying `createGraphicsPipeline`:

```c++
void createGraphicsPipeline() {
    ...
    multisampling.rasterizationSamples = msaaSamples;
    ...
}
```

Now run your program and you should see the following:

![](/images/multisampling.png)

Just like with mipmapping, the difference may not be apparent straight away when looking at this simple scene. On a closer look you'll notice that the edges on the roof are not as jagged anymore and the whole image seems a bit smoother compared to the original.

The difference is more noticable when looking up close at one of the edges:

## Conclusion

It has taken a lot of work to get to this point, but now you finally have a good
base for a Vulkan program. The knowledge of the basic principles of Vulkan that
you now possess should be sufficient to start exploring more of the features,
like:

* Push constants
* Instanced rendering
* Dynamic uniforms
* Separate images and sampler descriptors
* Pipeline cache
* Multi-threaded command buffer generation
* Multiple subpasses
* Compute shaders

The current program can be extended in many ways, like adding Blinn-Phong
lighting, post-processing effects and shadow mapping. You should be able to
learn how these effects work from tutorials for other APIs, because despite
Vulkan's explicitness, many concepts still work the same.
